# Reading-List-Sequelized

##### Full stack web app using MySQL, Sequelize, Node.js, Express.js, and Handlebars and deployed through Heroku

This full stack web application connects with a Heroku JawsDB database to add, update, and delete books from an online reading list through sequelize models and queries. A reader can also be added to each book and updated. It can also be run on a localhost server by providing a sequelize .config file. MVC architecture is used to access and communicate with the database and display the information on the browser.
